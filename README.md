### Running the Program

Main class: src/main/java/oolala/Main.java

How to use the program:
When starting to run the program, you are given two buttons to start: Logo and L-System. 
Logo runs like a command line, but you can input multiple commands at the same time. 
You can also use it like a command line because pressing up and down on the keyboard will progress forward and backward through previous commands.
L-system runs with a text editor and a run button which runs the entire document.
You can save the document you created with the save button, and load any document to be run with the load button.

Data files needed: 
- turtle.png

Features implemented:
- enter and run programs interactively
- display the results of executing the commands visually
- see errors that may result from entered commands in a user-friendly way
- reuse commands previously entered again easily 



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: 

Interesting data files:

Known Bugs:
- The turtle and the lines will center itself in the window (the object will move around when doing commands)
- Stamp for turtle only works when it is the only command used

Extra features:
