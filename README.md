### Running the Program

Main class: src/main/java/oolala/Main.java

How to use the program:
When starting to run the program, you are given three buttons to start: apps 1-3. 
Logo is app 1 because apps 2 and 3 will be coming soon.
Logo runs like a command line, but you can input multiple commands at the same time. 
You can also use it like a command line because pressing up and down on the keyboard will progress forward and backward through previous commands.

Data files needed: 
- turtle.png

Features implemented:
- enter and run programs interactively
- display the results of executing the commands visually
- see errors that may result from entered commands in a user-friendly way
- reuse commands previously entered again easily 



### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications:

Interesting data files:

Known Bugs:
- The turtle and the lines will center itself in the window (the object will move around when doing commands)

Extra features:
